Because we use the asyncio module, you will not be able to use any other versions of Python.\r\n\r\nTo install CloudBot on *nix (linux, etc), see [here](https://github.com/CloudBotIRC/CloudBot/wiki/Installing-on-*nix)\r\n\r\nTo install CloudBot on Windows, see [here](https://github.com/CloudBotIRC/CloudBot/wiki/Installing-on-Windows)\r\n\r\nIf you're going to be actively developing on CloudBot, and submitting PRs back, you can run CloudBot inside Vagrant. This allows everyone to have an identical development environment.\r\n\r\nTo install CloudBot in Vagrant (both *Unix and Windows), see [here](https://github.com/CloudBotIRC/CloudBot/wiki/Installing-with-Vagrant)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Running CloudBot\r\n\r\nBefore you run the bot, rename `config.default` to `config.json` and edit it with your preferred settings. You can check if your JSON is valid using [jsonlint.com](http://jsonlint.com/)!\r\n\r\nOnce you have installed the required dependencies and renamed the config file, you can run the bot! Make sure you are in the correct folder and run the following command:\r\n\r\n```\r\npython3.4 -m cloudbot\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that you can also run the `cloudbot/__main__.py` file directly, which will work from any directory.\r\n```\r\npython3.4 CloudBotRefresh/cloudbot/__main__.py\r\n```\r\nSpecify the path as /path/to/repository/cloudbot/__main__.py, where `cloudbot` is inside the repository directory.\r\n\r\n## Getting help with CloudBot\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\nThe CloudBot documentation is currently somewhat outdated and may not be correct.
